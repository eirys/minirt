# minirt
My 42 project miniRT, group project with @sdummett

`make bonus`.

`./miniRT scenes/{scene}.rt`

This is a miniraytracer.
Features:
  - shapes: sphere, cylinder, plane, cone
  - Lambert-Phong illuminance model
  - Checkerboard pattern
  - Colored lighting
  - Multiple spots

NB:
  - this is the Linux MLX
  - I'll clean up the garbage code once I'm done with transcendance...
